# Literature review topics

If you are interested in conducting a literature review on one of the subjects described below, get in touch with a short email to Emiel van Loon.

## Two topics in support of research in the Oostvaardersplassen

The Oostvaardersplassen (OVP), now part of [Park Nieuwland](https://www.nationaalparknieuwland.nl/en/the-park), is an important nature reserve in the Netherlands.
Together with Staatsbosbeheer (the terrain managing organisation in the OVP) the University of Amsterdam conducts long-term research in the area.

One of the topics under investigation is the interaction between grazing by various mammals and birds, vegetation dynamics, soil ecology and organic matter dynamnics.
In support of this research, the following two questions have been identified to be answered on the basis of literature.

### How is grazing intensity quantified?

Different grazers are present at the OVP grasslands. We would like to quantify the grazing intensities of these species to understand their impact. 
A first step is to determine the grazing rates of individual animals and generalize that to species or even species groups.
Basic animal physiology and ecology learns us that there are large differences in grazing rates between species, and that there might also be relevant differences between individuals. 
Besides, there are species which pause regularly (for digestion or due to disturbance).
For these reasons it may not be trivial to translate presence of grazers into grazing rates and intensities. 
This review aims at finding and summarizing known methods for determining grazing rates from the literature. 
We are interested in both the conceptual ideas (and models) to translate presence or activity by a species into grazing rates and
concrete worflows to translate digitally borne data (e.g. camera footage) into grazing rate.

### How is the relation between soil moisture, soil temperature and grazing intensity been described and/or modeled?

We are interested in the relation between soil organic matter change and grazing, also considering mediating/moderating variables like standing plant biomass, 
species composition, soil properties and weather (mainly temperature and rainfall).
We are conducting experiments at OVP to test the effect sizes of some expected relations in this system. As part of the evaluation of the experimental results, we
will make comparisons findings from the scientific literature as well as existing models which include these interactions. The proposed literature study will help us to screen and evaluate
the relevant literature systematically.
